# Project Overview

Project Name: Hello World with a Twist

Description: A very basic web application demonstrating the "Hello World" concept, but with an intentional bug for validation testing.

Features:

*   "Hello World" Page: Displays the text "Hello World!".
*   "Sing Happy Birthday" Page (Intentional Bug): When accessed, this page attempts to execute a non-existent function "singHappyBirthday()". This is designed to trigger a validation error.

Target Audience: Developers and testers who want to see the validation system in action.

Technology Stack:

*   Cloudflare next-on-pages framework (NextJS) for the web application.
*   Basic HTML/JavaScript for page content and the intentional bug.
